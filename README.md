# vim-cheat-sheet-html
Collaboration of vim cheat sheets I've found and put them in a html file

I thought there were nice vim cheat sheets out there (vim.rtorr.com) but I like how people post some of the tricks and short hand ways that people use shortcuts etc.
This vim cheat sheet has other vim cheat sheet items in it but it also has the ones I've found on the web where I thought were neat to know.

I really like the vim.rorr.com format and this index.html cheat sheet goes along with that. 
I also wanted to have  an easy one index.html file where anyone can just load in their browser locally or have easily on web.

If you have any neat vim key combinations that you want to add, make a PR! More than happy to add them
